# Gamified Learning App: User Engagement Analytics

## Project Overview

As part of my MSBA program, I analyzed user behavior patterns for a gamified learning platform to identify growth opportunities and optimize user retention. Using statistical analysis and predictive modeling, I discovered actionable insights about notification strategies, user onboarding optimization, and churn prevention that could drive measurable business impact.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Conduct funnel analysis to identify user conversion opportunities
- Perform statistical A/B testing on notification timing strategies  
- Develop predictive models for proactive churn prevention
- Design KPI dashboards for real-time business monitoring
- Create actionable recommendations with quantified business impact

## Synthetic Data Context

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Scale:** 75,000+ simulated user events across 6 months
- **Realism:** Statistically valid behavioral patterns with realistic correlations
- **Complexity:** Multi-dimensional engagement metrics including lessons completed, streak achievements, session frequency, and notification preferences

### Why Synthetic Data?
- **Privacy First:** No real user data means no privacy concerns or regulatory headaches
- **Clean Testing:** I can focus on the analysis techniques without worrying about messy real-world data issues
- **Show Scale:** Demonstrates how these methods work on large datasets (75K+ users)
- **Reproducible:** Anyone can run this analysis and get the same results

I built the synthetic dataset to behave like real users would - with realistic correlations between engagement and retention, seasonal signup patterns, and logical relationships between features like lesson completion and streak achievements.
